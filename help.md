# Initial Setup

You need to have *Node.js* and *npm* installed on your computer in order to test the app. If you type **"npm version"** into your terminal, you should see a line for npm and a line for node in the results.

If you do not have these installed, go [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download), select the current version at the top, then download the **prebuilt** version for your operating system at the bottom.

After cloning this repository and after you have npm installed, open a terminal and type **"npm update"** while in the project folder. This checks the **package.json** for any new packages that need to be installed on your local repository.

## Testing the app

In the terminal type **"npm run dev"** to start the server, then in your browser type **"localhost:5173"** to connect.

*Note: You may need to download npm on your device*

## Organization

Be mindful when moving around assets and reorganizing folders, as it may effect files outside of what you are working on 😃
